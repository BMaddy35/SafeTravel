# Safe Travel

### Problem
As the world struggles to re-open allowing for safe cross border travel, the challenge is to keep up and stay up-to-date with the latest in Travel advisory & Restrictions.

Covid-19 specific information especially Vaccination, Health & Quarantine conditions are paramount condition for any Travel to take place. The information has been standardised up to an extent but still exists in silos. Apparently not ALL relevant information is accessible from one place.

### Solution
The IDEA is to have a simple ChatBot application stitching data points together for Travellers and Travel planners to access content easily.
